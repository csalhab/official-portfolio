            I have a
            <span class="word-highlights"
              >Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science & Mathematics</span

            from Pace University.
          </p>
          <p>At the end of September 2021, I
            completed a summer semester Full Stack Developer Bootcamp course
            with
            <span class="word-highlights">Columbia University</span>,
            receiving an A+ along with my <a href="./assets/images/columbia-university-certificate.png" target="_blank" class="columbia-cert">certificate</a>.
          </p>
          <p>I live in the Bronx borough of NYC, Riverdale specifically.</p>
          <p>
            Since middle of February 2022, I have been working for a finTech company as a Sr. Solutions Engineer supporting <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot" target="_blank" class="columbia-cert">a Java Spring Boot Microservices</a> product that has over 25 services as part of its platform and it has both Vue.js & ReactJS front-ends as well. I'm also gaining valuable experience with Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, DataGrip IDE, Kibana logs & AWS.
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
            Professionally, I have an extensive career, starting as a
            <span class="word-bold">Web Developer</span> initially and for
            about 7 years and then I moved into <span class="word-bold">Software Engineering</span> and have been a SWE ever since. These last 5 years, in the Sr Integration Engineer role, I discovered that I am <span class="word-highlights">very comfortable being in front of customers and thrived</span> just as much as being a collaborator/Software Engineer with Development & Engineering teams. I helped so many developers and vendors not just understand the mature video analytics engine but also assisted them to integrate its APIs via pair programming and validate the code using several testing tools and approaches. I also provided guidance and support to many non-technical partners.
          </p>
          <p>
            My favorite programming language is
            <span class="word-bold">Java</span> and I like building
            <span class="word-bold">RESTful APIs</span> as well as working in
            <span class="word-bold">Android Studio</span> coding Android
            mobile apps. I have extensive experience with OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) & Design Patterns such as MVC (Model View Controller).
          </p>
          <p>
            I have spent these last several months brushing up on
            <span class="word-highlights"
              >JavaScript, CSS & learning the MERN Stack</span
            >. And I've learned a great deal on:
            
            <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
              <li>ReactJS</li>
              <li>React State Management/Global Context & Redux</li>
              <li>NodeJS & Express Server</li>
              <li>Apollo Server with GraphQL</li>
              <li>ORM (Object-Relational
                Mapping), Data Modeling & Sequelize</li>
              <li>TDD (Test Driven Development) & Mock</li>
              <li>Templating Engines</li>
              <li>WEB, 3rd Party & Server API's</li>
              <li>PWA (Progressive Web Apps)</li>
              <li>Heroku deployment</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            I do have experience with databases as well, with both RDBMS
            (<span class="word-highlights">MySQL, MS SQL Server & Oracle</span
            >) and NoSQL (<span class="word-highlights">MongoDB</span>).
          </p>
          <p>
            My experience also extends into <span class="word-bold">analytics</span>, both page metrics and video quality of experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            My strengths span hands-on technical programming in several current
            languages such as Java, HTML5, Javascript, CSS and SQL. I've also had to code
            in Objective-C/PHP/BrightScript/Perl.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a believer in planning and have a lot of experience in <span class="word-bold">Project & Resource Management</span>. I've had to do a lot of requirements gathering too as part of that planning and leverage ticketing systems tools such as JIRA and Trello to assist with breaking down the work. I have a lot of <span class="word-highlights">Agile</span> experience too.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am extremely creative and have had experience designing UI. I worked in graphic and catalogue design as well as photo retouching before dedicating my career to coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            More than half of my career has covered most aspects of <span class="word-highlights">video</span>: from encoding, to queuing, to player development, to API development for players to leverage, to back-end systems engineering that support services players rely on to various analytic engines, advertising frameworks, payment gateway systems, AuthN login checks, AuthZ entitlement checks, tokenization, blackout services and stream limiting integrations.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the personal side, I'm not originally from the United States
            but I am, now for over 35 years, a
            <span class="word-highlights"
              >Naturalized Citizen of the United States</span
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was born in Brasil, (I also have Lebanese heritage) in the state
            of Pará in a city called Belém (which translates to Bethlehem in
            English). This state is in Brasil's north and the city is a basin
            city to the Amazon River.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fun fact: Belem is located just over a degree below the Equator & it's summer year round.
          </p>
          <p>
            Portuguese is my 1st language and English is actually my 3rd
            language and that's because when I moved to the United States when
            I was 5 years old, there were no Portuguese speaking teachers
            available in the school district. So I was assigned a Spanish
            speaking teacher (who was brilliant and found similar words in
            Spanish to Portuguese and while she taught me English, she also
            taught me Spanish).
          </p>
          <p>
            So when I was deciding what to study in university, I decided to
            study programming/coding because I enjoyed that experience in
            learning the Spanish & English languages. And I've not been
            disappointed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="word-highlights">I'm a strong debugger</span>. And I've had to troubleshoot and reverse engineer code many times.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="word-bold"
              >As a teammate, I'm very encouraging and supportive and always
              offering to help and making myself available</span
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            I work hard to keep up with current technologies and look forward
            to my next adventure in Software Engineering.
